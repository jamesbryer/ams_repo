# The cat who likes to *collect* **hats**

## Chapter 1

Once upon a time, there was a cat who had a very peculiar hobby: collecting **hats**. This cat, who we will call Fluffy, loved nothing more than scouring the neighborhood for the most interesting hats she could find. Whether it was:

- a bowler hat
- a sunhat
- an old baseball cap

Fluffy was determined to find them all. She had a special knack for finding the most unique hats - some of them vintage, some of them new. Every time she went out, she'd come back with a new hat to add to her ever-growing collection.

Fluffy soon became the topic of conversation in the neighborhood. Everyone was amazed that a cat could show such an interest in hats. But Fluffy was determined to keep collecting and adding to her collection. She would spend hours trying on her new hats and admiring herself in the mirror.

## Chapter 2

One day, Fluffy decided to take her hat collection to the local craft fair. Everyone was amazed at the size and variety of her collection. Soon she was selling her hats to the other attendees of the fair, and making quite a bit of money in the process.

Fluffy's hat collecting hobby has become quite the success story. She now has her own shop in the neighborhood where she sells her hats to everyone who stops by. Who knows how far her hat collecting hobby will take her? One thing is for sure - she'll never stop collecting hats!

In Python, we can use the `os` module to get the current working directory:
